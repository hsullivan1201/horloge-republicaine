# TODO

## Done

- [x] Menu bar clock (MenuBarExtra with popover: clock, almanac, quit)
- [x] Browse other months (chevrons in the calendar panel)
- [x] Almanac window with the full lore, all 366 day names translated
- [x] French/English mode

## Ideas

- App icon (a cockade, or a 10-hour watch face)
- Menu-bar-only mode: set `LSUIElement` to `true` in Info.plist to hide the Dock icon (needs a way to toggle it back)
- Option to show the Republican date instead of (or with) the time in the menu bar
- Launch at login via `SMAppService.mainApp.register()`
- True equinox-based year start (Meeus algorithm) as an option, for the calendar purists
- Browse other years in the almanac, with Gregorian date conversion both ways
- Notification at each new décadi, for the day of rest
